# Day 3 - Treasure Island

## Description
A text based adventure game where the player makes choices that determine whether they find the treasure or meet an unfortunate end. This project builds logic branching skills and introduces multi step decision paths.

## What I Learned
- Using conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Handling multi step decision trees
- Nesting conditionals to create story flow
- Working with string comparisons
- Designing simple command line interactions
- Structuring readable game logic

## How It Works
1. The game displays a short introduction and sets the scene.
2. The player makes a choice at the first crossroads.
3. Based on the selection, the story branches into different outcomes.
4. The player continues making decisions that lead to:
   - A win by finding the treasure
   - A loss due to a wrong path or dangerous choice
5. The program ends with either a victory message or a game over message.

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
