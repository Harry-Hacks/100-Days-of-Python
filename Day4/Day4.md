# Day 4 - Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Description
A command line Rock Paper Scissors game where the user picks a move and the computer randomly selects its own move. The program compares both choices and determines the winner. This project reinforces conditionals and randomness in Python.

## What I Learned
- Using the `random` module to generate unpredictable outcomes
- Comparing user and computer choices with conditionals
- Handling user input and validating expected values
- Organizing game logic into clean steps
- Displaying results in a user friendly format

## How It Works
1. The user selects rock, paper, or scissors.
2. The computer randomly chooses one of the same options.
3. The program compares both choices.
4. The result is printed as win, lose, or draw.
