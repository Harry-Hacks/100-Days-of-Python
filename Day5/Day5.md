# Day 5 - Password Generator

## Description
A password generator tool that creates random, secure passwords using letters, numbers, and symbols. The user can choose how many characters of each type they want. This project builds comfort with loops, randomization, and list manipulation.

## What I Learned
- Using the `random` module for selecting characters
- Working with lists of letters, numbers, and symbols
- Looping to build collections of random characters
- Shuffling a list to randomize order
- Converting lists into strings
- Designing user input driven logic

## How It Works
1. The user specifies:
   - Number of letters  
   - Number of numbers  
   - Number of symbols  
2. The program selects random characters from predefined lists.
3. It combines all chosen characters and shuffles them.
4. The final password is printed as one continuous string.
