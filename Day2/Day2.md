# Day 2 - Tip Calculator

## Description
A program that calculates the total bill including tip and splits it between any number of people. This project builds confidence with numbers, user input, and basic arithmetic.

## What I Learned
- Converting user input from strings to numbers using `int()` and `float()`
- Cleaning and formatting numeric output using `round()`
- Basic arithmetic operations in Python
- Working with multiple user inputs
- Structuring a small script with clear logic

## How It Works
1. The user enters the total bill amount.
2. The user chooses a tip percentage such as 10, 12, or 15.
3. The program calculates the final total including tip.
4. The total is divided by the number of people.
5. The result displays the amount each person should pay.
