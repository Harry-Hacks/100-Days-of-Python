# Day 1 - Band Name Generator

## Description
A simple program that generates a fun band name based on two user inputs: their hometown and the name of their pet. This project introduces basic user interaction with input prompts and string handling.

## What I Learned
- Using `input()` to capture user provided data
- Concatenating strings to form output
- Creating simple interactive scripts
- Running Python files in PyCharm
- Using variables to store and use user input

## How It Works
1. The program asks the user for the name of their hometown.
2. It then asks for their pet's name.
3. The two inputs are combined to form a creative band name.
4. The final band name is printed for the user.
